# Yummy-Resturant

PHP/Laravel Web application for restaurants that let customer can book tables and contact owners. I am responsible for the back-end part (I have finished it, but I am developing and enhancing it on it)

### client can book table and send message to stuff from front view.    
### clients  will receive mails  that confirm receiving staff for their mails.    
     
  
     
### Admins and users they can work with a dashboard with full authentication system, but only admins can add users and set permissions for using the dashboard.     
### they can receive clients mails and confirm booked table by clients and can book tables.    
### once they confirm booked tables, the clients receive automatically an email with confirmation.     
### users and admins can update and edit on all front view parts by the dashboard.     
### admins only can delete messages from clients and add, update, delete and change permission of users.      



    
## First step  
    you have to migrate and seed database to create user credentials for test, And create data for website parts. 

    Email : admin1@test.com
