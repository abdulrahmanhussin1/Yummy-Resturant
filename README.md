# Yummy-Resturant

PHP/Laravel Web application for restaurants lets customers book tables and contact owners. I am responsible for the back-end part (I have finished it, but I am developing and enhancing it on it)

The client can book a table and send messages to staff from the front view.  
Clients will receive emails that confirm receiving staff for their emails.  
Admins and users can work with a dashboard with a full authentication system, but only admins can add users and set permissions for using the dashboard.  
They can receive clients' emails and confirm booked tables by clients and can reserve tables.  
Once they confirm booked tables, the clients receive automatically an email with confirmation.  
Users and admins can update and edit all front-view parts by the dashboard.  
Admins only can delete messages from clients and add, update, delete, and change the permission of users.      



    
## First step  
    you have to migrate and seed database to create user credentials for test, And create data for website parts. 

    Email : admin1@test.com
    password : admin1234
